# Signal Creation and Manipulation Project
This Python project focuses on generating, modifying, and visualizing basic signals.
It includes a collection of functions for signal generation as well as scripts that demonstrate how these signals can be plotted and manipulated.
## Signals Covered
The project creates and displays:

- A sinusoidal signal

- A unit step function

- A time-shifted sinusoidal signal

- A time-shifted and time-scaled sinusoidal signal

## How to Run
To run the project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (numpy, matplotlib, scipy).
The repository contains multiple Python files:

One file defines all the signal functions.

Other files demonstrate plotting and transformations of the signals.

Run a file using:

python <filename>.py


This will open plots of the signals with time on the x-axis and amplitude on the y-axis
