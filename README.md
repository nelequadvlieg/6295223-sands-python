# Signal Generation Project
A lightweight Python program for creating and displaying basic signals.
## Signals included
This project produces and visualizes the following types of signals:

Sinusoidal wave

Unit step function

Sinusoidal wave with a time delay

Sinusoidal wave with both a delay and time scaling
## Running the system
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. To execute the project, run:

python run.py


After running, you will see four plots showing the signals, with time on the horizontal axis and amplitude on the vertical axis.
